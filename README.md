# EDA-on-Video-Games-Sales-Dataset

## Introduction

For the past few days I was learning Python for Data Analysis and I think it's about time to put into a test my new gained knowledge 
by making a data analysis project. As a beginner data analyst/scientist, my codes may not be efficient or good so please bear with me haha. 
Anyway, any comments and suggestions will be greatly appreciated!


## About the Dataset

I found this dataset that caught my attention and interest from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sidtwr/videogames-sales-dataset). 
This is a video games sales dataset that is scraped (on Dec., 2016) from [vgchartz](https://www.vgchartz.com/), a website that tracks 
the sales of physical copies of games for different console/platforms. I found this dataset to be interesting and great to start my first project on.


## About data cleaning and transformation procedures
The data cleaning and transformation procedures is not included in this notebook and I instead placed it in another notebook file which is located
in this directory: `./data_cleaning_script.ipynb/` . If you have concerns about the data cleaning and transformation procedures, please refer to this notebook file.
